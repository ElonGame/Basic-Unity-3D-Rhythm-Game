# Basic-Unity-3D-Rhythm-Game
Project folder for a very basic 3D rhythm game done in 3 weeks for an introductory game development course. This is mostly up for future reference to [the scripts folder](CosmicMovement_Project/Assets/Scripts), but the whole project is present.

You can use it by cloning the repo and opening the CosmicMovement_Project folder with Unity.
